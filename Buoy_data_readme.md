#What I have done in buoy data:

#a) for there are many records each day, I calculate the average of them so we have one entry for one day.
#b) split the strings and some other data clean work.
#c) combine all data into one file.

#If you want to use it:
#1. download the "buoydt.csv" file 
#2. enter the code 
buoy.data <- read_csv("buoydt.csv")
